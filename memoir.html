            Nisei at Roosevelt. One of my friends was Gladys Tamura. Her family had
            a commercial garden where University Village Shopping Mall stands now.
            Later, during the war, after the Nisei had been taken to camps, it was
            used for a Community Victory Garden. Gladys and I walked to and from
            school together the year we lived in the Rovenne district. Those Nisei
            that I remember were popular with others and participated in school
            activities, won athletic letters and so on. If you had asked me then,
            I would have said they were socially more secure than I felt as a Dust

            about wartime Washington, but figured the Navy would give us some
            help in finding a place to live. Dismayed as we were over our
            housing, we got ourselves together to report with several others to
            the Chief of Naval Operations office at the Navy Department. While
            wandering about the corridors, a tall, white&#8208;haired man came
            walking past us and we got a glimpse of more gold braid then we had

            should we do?" Someone said, "Remember, the Navy never salutes
            indoors. Don't salute!" At Northampton we had been conditioned to
            salute everything in sight lest we be put on report, but in
            Washington, we learned to take rank a bit more casually.

         Of course the fighting isn't over yet, but it has been reduced to
         such an extent that most of us are feeling quite optimistic."
         </hi> He had been made a temporary Marine in the fourth Marine
         Division for the Iwo invasion and landed on the beach the morning
         of the "D" day, at the time the Japanese began the most intensive
         firing at the beach. They let the first Marines in without much

         Like everyone else, we were stunned. But it had special meaning
         for us because Franklin D. Roosevelt had been President of the
         United States from the time we were eight or nine years old.
         We had never known another President and besides, Roosevelt was
         definitely a father figure, not only to us, but to people all
         over the world. And the horrors of the world were still with us,
         with the end still not in sight. We needed a leader.
