        <p>We included sections of Lois Horn's memoir that dealt with her experiences in WAVES, as well as her
    experiences that displayed gender and race&#8208;relations. Horn's experiences indicate gender based
    prejudices and discrimination in education and in WAVES. These sections displayed instances where men tried to hinder
    Horn's ambitions, challenged her and her fellow female officer's authority,
    and stories of sexual harrassment or discrimination that was experienced in the workplace or housing. Addtionally, we
    selected sections that displayed race&#8208;relations in WAVES. Living in the United States during the War, Lois Horn makes
    frequent note on her experience with Japanese Americans, as well as effects of systemic discrimination against
    Japanese people during the war. The other major aspect of race found within the memoir has to do with Lois Horn's platoon, which contained the first two
    African American Women naval officers in WAVES. These selected sections relate to race&#8208;relations and explore
    how White women serving in WAVES reacted to the full integration of African Americans in their
    platoon, especially during an era when segregation was prominent in the United
    States. Moreover, we included sections that address how the media covered Lois Horn's graduation
    with a particular focus on race and how the percieved racial dynamic in WAVES was conveyed to the American
    public. Overall, the sections that we selected were intended to give the reader a glimpse into the
    gender and racial influences that were present in WAVES and American society during the mid&#8208;1940s
    through Lois Horn's firsthand account.</p>
