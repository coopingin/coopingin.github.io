        <h1>Lois Horn</h1>
        <p class="index"> "Lois Logan Horn was born in Haigler in April 1923.
          She studied Japanese Studies as an undergraduate and also earned her
          masters in social work degree from University of Washington. Before
          the age of six, her family moved to Ohio farm when the Nebraska State
          Banks broke. Later they moved to Omaha and later to Sandhills on
          Pine Creek. In 1936, they finally settled at Seattle.<p>

          <p class="index">During the World War II, she served in WAVES. She played pivotal roles
          in translating Japanese messages as a U.S. Navy Communications Intelligence
          officer between 1944-1945. She was also involved in a social work career
          with Seattle Schools, Children’s Hospital, and childcare agencies in Seattle.</p>

          <p class="index">Because of her passion for Japanese social and cultural trends, she wrote
          on this topic for the University of Washington independent study. Louis
          married Robert, a Boeing manager at the mitsubishi Nagoya Aircraft Works.
          Horn wrote and published books such as Rozella (1981), Outside Person (1989),
          Lois Logan Papers (2000), and others. “Rozella” narrates Horn’s mother’s life
          (Rozella Redd Logan) who lived between 1888—1977. It is a book that pays homage
          to her memories. Narrated through the storytelling technique—the idea of oral history,
          the book has different short stories that capture Rozella Redd Logan’s life. “Outside Person”
          explores the expatriate life for Americans in Japan. It is refreshing and detailed book on
          Japanese history, culture, geography and current trends. In this book she captures her travels
          throughout Japan by car. Through these travels, she renders the beauty of Japan: the mountain
          and sea scenery, home visits on farms and in cities, community festivals, shrine sales, Shinto
          ceremonies, and Japanese inns. “Lois Logan Papers” is a comprehensive personal memoir that explores
          the larger-than-life personality of Horn through her family and friends and her experiences in the World War II.
          It also documents some letters and legal papers for property owned by Horn’s parents."</p>
