	       <p.editorial style="font-size: 14pt">Frances Wills was one of the first African American women to serve in WAVES
            (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service) as a female officer in the women's reserve
             for the U.S. Navy. She was commissioned as an ensign naval officer and served from 1944-45
              in Northampton, Massachusetts as well as in New York, New York. Prior to her service, Wills
               graduated from George Washington High School and Hunter College (Frances E. Wills Thorpe).
                Furthermore, she continued with her education at the University of Pittsburgh, where she
                pursued a master's degree in social work. Taking advantage of the new opportunities presented
                 by the U.S. Navy, she signed up to join WAVES and trained at Smith College's Naval Reserve
                 Midshipmen's School along with Harriet Pickens (Frances Wills, Naval Officer Born and Frances
                 E. Wills Thorpe). Following her training at Smith College, she taught naval history to new recruits
                  at the Hunter Naval Training Station (Frances E. Wills Thorpe).</p.editorial>

             (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service) as a female officer in the women's reserve
              for the U.S. Navy. She was commissioned as a lieutenant (junior grade) naval officer and served

                    <p.editorial style="font-size: 14pt">The SV Fantome was a steel-hulled sailing yacht built for Great Britain’s
                     Duke of Westminster in 1927, and later acquired by beer baron Ernest Guinness.
                      She sailed into Seattle in 1939 and became stranded by the outbreak of World War II.
                      After the war, King County blocked her departure in an effort to recover property taxes from Guiness.
                      The vessel ended up resting at anchor in Portage Bay for a total of nearly 14 years.</p.editorial>

                  <p.editorial style="font-size: 14pt">The Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) was legislated in 1942 through Public
                 Law 689. The legislation enabled women to serve in women's reserve for the U.S. Navy. Even
                 though the legislation never explicitly barred African American women from enlisting, racial
                 prejudice and discriminiation in the armed forces prevented African American women from
                 enlisting in WAVES. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) lobbied for
                 integration. Prominent political figures, such as Eleanor Roosevelt, also supported the
                 integration of People of Color in WAVES. Under Secretary of the Navy, William Knox, had opposed
                 the activists' pleas. In 1944, Knox passed away and was no longer a hurdle to the activists'
                 cause. Activists continued to pressure law makers, leaders in WAVES, as well as President Franklin
                 D. Roosevelt. In October of 1944, Roosevelt authorized the full integration of American American
                 women in WAVES. Harriet Pickens and Frances Wills were the first African American women to
                 enlist in WAVES, complete the officer training program, and serve as naval officers (’We Made
                 it, Friend’ The First African American Female Officers in the US Navy).</p.editorial>
