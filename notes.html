 <span class=”label”>WAVES</span>

 <p.editorial>The Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) was legislated in 1942 through Public
Law 689. The legislation enabled women to serve in women's reserve for the U.S. Navy. Even
though the legislation never explicitly barred African American women from enlisting, racial
prejudice and discriminiation in the armed forces prevented African American women from
enlisting in WAVES. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) lobbied for
integration. Prominent political figures, such as Eleanor Roosevelt, also supported the
integration of People of Color in WAVES. Under Secretary of the Navy, William Knox, had opposed
the activists' pleas. In 1944, Knox passed away and was no longer a hurdle to the activists'
cause. Activists continued to pressure law makers, leaders in WAVES, as well as President Franklin
D. Roosevelt. In October of 1944, Roosevelt authorized the full integration of American American
women in WAVES. Harriet Pickens and Frances Wills were the first African American women to
enlist in WAVES, complete the officer training program, and serve as naval officers (’We Made
it, Friend’ The First African American Female Officers in the US Navy). </p.editorial>
